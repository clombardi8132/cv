      <p>Hello, my name is Chris Lombardi. In my free time I spend time with my wife and daughter,
        usually watching my daughter play soccer, and working on projects around the house.<br />
        I decided to pursue the full stack development certification for a possible career change.
        I look forward to learning new skills.</p></td>
